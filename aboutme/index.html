    <h2>Hannah Anderson</h2>
    <p>
        I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. I enjoy coding, and hope to eventually go into web and software design and/or video game development.
       <br/>
       <br/>
        I enjoy reading, singing, listening to music, writing poetry, creating art, playing video games, and baking. My favorite book series is <span>The City Between</span> by W.R. Gingell, and my favorite video games are <span>Portal 2</span> and <span>Skyrim</span>. I love <span>Star Wars</span>, and I even built my own diy lightsaber.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My favorite quote is "Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith" (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, <span>Come, Join with Us</span>), and my favorite scripture is <span>D&C</span> 6:36 "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."
