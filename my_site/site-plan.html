      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my website is to be a place for me to mess around and explore the possibilities of web design and development. The website will include an about me section, a blog section, a gallery for any art or comics I might decide to put in, and individual pages for each image to be displayed full size. Kind of like a fusion of Deviantart and Tumblr that only has one person using it. It will also serve as home to my personal projects and experiments with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hello!
        <br/><br/>
        My name is Hannah Anderson.
        <br/><br/>
        I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. I enjoy coding, and hope to eventually go into web and software design and/or video game development.
        <br/><br/>
        I enjoy reading, singing, listening to music, writing poetry, creating art, playing video games, and baking. My favorite book series is The City Between by W.R. Gingell, and my favorite video games are Portal 2 and Skyrim. I love Star Wars, and I even built my own DIY lightsaber.
        <br/><br/>
        My favorite quote is "Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith" (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, Come, Join with Us, and my favorite scripture is D&C 6:36 "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."

        Coconut Cream Custard
        <br/>
        Makes 2 Servings
        <br/>
        Ingredients
        <br/>
        ½ cup coconut cream
        <br/>
        ½ cup cream
        <br/>
        2 tbsp sugar
        <br/>
        1 beaten egg
        <br/>
        ¼ tsp vanilla 
        <br/>
        1 tbsp super tiny bits of shredded coconut, unsweetened 
        <br/>
        Preparation
        <br/>
        Mix all the ingredients together very thoroughly. 
        <br/>
        Pour into a pan, turn heat to medium.
        <br/>
        Stir constantly while scraping the bottom to make sure none burns.
        <br/>
        When thickened and just barely beginning to bubble, remove from the pan and cool. 

        <br/><br/>
        FLOWERS
        <br/>
        As I was walking home from the bus stop one day, I happened to look down and notice some flowers growing in the grass beside the sidewalk. These flowers blooming in such an unexpected place were so wondrous and pure to me, nature’s beauty springing from the mundane. 
        <br/>
        The grass was eventually mowed and the flowers were lost, but whenever I remember this image, I am struck again by the knowledge that nature so often fights our attempts to tame and suppress it by the simple means of growing flowers where we planted none.

      <h3>Ghost Room</h3>
      <p>
        GHOST ROOM
        <br/>
        This is a room I had to make as part of an assignment for my Japanese class in high school. We had to draw a room with objects in different locations (right, left, front, back, behind, above, etc.) and then describe it in Japanese to a classmate who would then also draw the room. 
        The purpose was to practice the words and grammar related to those positions, and by drawing the rooms we could see if we had used and understood them correctly and placed the items in the correct locations.

      <h3>Bubbles</h3>
      <p>
        BUBBLES
        <br/>
        This was my first attempt at drawing bubbles. I know now that bubbles need to be more transparent, and soap bubbles would have iridescence. Bubbles in water would not be as round as these ones when they first appear, and would wobble as they move, causing them to never be perfectly round.

      <h3>Wheatley</h3>
      <p>
        WHEATLEY
        <br/>
        I am a big fan of the Portal video game franchise. Wheatley is a spherical robot who appears in the second game, Portal 2, and he is my favorite character. I decided to try making him one day while messing around with learning to do pixel art.

        PHONE BACKGROUND
        <br/>
        This is a background I made for my phone because I didn’t like any of the pre-installed ones. 
        I made it in Procreate using the “Nebula” and “Bokeh Lights” brushes.

        GLOW
        <br/>
        Once when we were out camping, I saw a weird shape in one of the benches at the picnic table. It looked like some one had set down some hot object and it had melted grooves into the bench. I think the object might have been part of a camping stove because of its shape. I thought the shape looked cool so I took a picture of it and drew over it in one of my art apps.

      <h3>Eye</h3>
      <p>
        EYE
        <br/>
        During middle school and early high school I would often use highlighters and a couple of random sharpies I found to draw stuff on my papers when I was done with the assignments. I really liked the color combination of my red sharpie and my orange and yellow highlighters. One day I noticed that an explosion thing I had doodled looked kind of like an eye, so I took a picture and drew over it in one of my art apps.

      <h3>Roses</h3>
      <p>
        ROSES
        <br/>
        I made these roses while experimenting with the “Groovy” brush in Procreate. It works quite nicely for the petals, but I think a different brush would have worked better for the stems and leaves.

      <p>
        TABLET BACKGROUND
        <br/>
        I didn’t like the pre-installed backgrounds for my tablet, so I made a new one using the “Nebula”, “Bokeh Lights”, and “Light Leak” brushes in Procreate.
      </p>

        INTERSECTIONS
        <br/>
        I made this while messing around with the symmetry and color fill tools in Autodesk Sketchbook. I thought it was interesting to see the different shapes created as the rectangles intersected each other.
